## Minigames

### Antivirus emulator

The player gets a set of some files, with an extension, and in the role of antivirus he needs to decide, if the file is safe to use, or not.  
Some files are easy to decide as `.txt`, `.png`, or `.mp3`. But some as `.exe` or `.pdf` need to be put into the emulator, to get proper results.  
If the result from the emulator says it is a virus, then the file needs to be moved into quarantine, in another case it is allowed by dragging it into a safe space.

#### Education part

- Kids will learn how antivirus decides if a file is harmful by emulating it.
- Kids will learn about file extensions, which are good and which aren't.

### Virus footsteps

The player will have to compare the "footprints" of programs with the footprints of viruses to decide about the virus even faster.

#### Educational part

- Kids will learn how antivirus compares a file's hash with a hazard database an quickly decide if it is a virus.
