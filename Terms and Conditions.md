# Terms and Conditions

## Acceptance of Terms

By using *The Security Guide to the Internet* ("the Game") on Android or web platforms, you agree to these Terms and Conditions. If you are under the age of majority, a parent or legal guardian must accept these Terms on your behalf. Consent for optional data usage is collected through a checkbox. If you do not agree, do not use the Game.

## Anonymous Analytics and Performance Data Collection

We collect **anonymous analytics and performance data by default** to improve gameplay, fix bugs, and balance content. This data collection does **not** require user consent and does **not** contain personal information.

Collected data includes:

* Session length and timing
* Feature and level usage
* Crash reports and game errors
* Device type (e.g. tablet or phone)

This data is not linked to any individual user and is processed strictly for internal analysis.

## Optional Personal Data Collection with Consent

If consent is given via checkbox, users (or their guardians) may optionally provide the following personal data fields, which will be labeled in logs:

* Age
* Region
* School grade
* Gender

All of these fields are:

* **Optional**, even after consent is granted.
* **Voluntary** to fill — unfilled fields are not collected or used.
* **Used only internally** for aggregated, anonymized insights into user demographics.

Consent can be withdrawn at any time. Withdrawal stops further data labeling; previously collected data follows the retention policy below.

## Use of New Relic for Logging

All log data — both anonymous and optionally labeled — is sent to **New Relic**, a secure log aggregation tool used strictly for internal monitoring and debugging.

* New Relic does not process or access the data for its own use.
* It acts as a passive data viewer used only by the developer.

## Data Retention

All analytics and log data is retained for **30 days**, after which it is permanently deleted. This applies to both anonymous data and optionally labeled data provided with consent.

## No Account or Registration

The Game does **not** require any account, login, or personal identifiers. All core features are available without user registration.

## Children's Privacy and Parental Consent

This Game complies with **COPPA**, **GDPR-K**, and applicable privacy laws for minors:

* No personal data is collected without clear, verifiable **consent**.
* The Game works fully without any personal data.
* If consent is granted, each field is still optional.
* Personal data, if provided, is never shared or sold.
* Parents or guardians may revoke consent at any time.

## Disclaimers and Limitations

The Game is provided **“as is”**, without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee uninterrupted access, freedom from bugs, or specific educational outcomes.

To the extent allowed by law, liability for any issues arising from use of the Game is limited to zero monetary compensation, as the Game is provided free of charge.

## Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the **Czech Republic**. Any disputes related to these Terms will be handled under Czech jurisdiction unless otherwise required by local law.
